I am currently a junior Graduate Student pursuing a master degree in Computer Technology at [University of Chinese Academy of Science](https://english.ucas.ac.cn/) and [National Space Science Center](http://english.nssc.cas.cn/). I have received my bachelor degree in computer science and technology from [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/). I am looking for a Ph.D opportunity now for further research.

My research interests lie in **data mining** and **machine learning**, with a particular emphasis on **time series prediction**. The aim is to achieve high-accuracy predictions by utilizing appropriate data processing methods and machine learning models.

My future research will focus more on processing **multimodal temporal data** to improve prediction accuracy and interpretability. Additionally, I have a strong interest in generative models and seek to conduct research in the area of **temporal diffusion models**.

I was honored to be advised by [Professor Linlin Wang](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~wanglinlin) and [Changbin Xue](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~xuechangbin) at [Key Laboratory of Electronic Information Technology for Complex Space Systems](https://www.nssc.cas.cn/gjzdsys2015/seit/) starting from 2022, where my focus on solving the problem of design and verification of spaceborne universal fault detection, isolation, and recovery(FDIR) platform.

I am eager to continue my research work and confident in my ability to excel as a highly self-motivated Ph.D candidate. If you are interested in collaborating with me, please feel free to contact me via email: **lichao_20011102@163.com** [Contact me](mailto:lichao_20011102@163.com) or WeChat: **ch15172521750**.
