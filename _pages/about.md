I am currently a junior Graduate Student pursuing a master degree in Computer Technology at [University of Chinese Academy of Science](https://english.ucas.ac.cn/) and [National Space Science Center](http://english.nssc.cas.cn/). I have received my bachelor degree in computer science and technology from [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/). I am looking for a Ph.D opportunity now for further research.

My research interests lie in _data mining_ and _machine learning_, with a particular emphasis on _time series prediction_. The aim is to achieve high-accuracy predictions by utilizing appropriate data processing methods and machine learning models.

My future research will focus more on processing _multimodal temporal data_ to improve prediction accuracy and interpretability. Additionally, I have a strong interest in generative models and seek to conduct research in the area of _temporal diffusion models_.

I was honored to be advised by [Professor Linlin Wang](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~wanglinlin) and [Changbin Xue](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~xuechangbin) at Key Laboratory of Electronic Information Technology for Complex Space Systems starting from 2022, where my focus on solving the problem of design and verification of spaceborne universal fault detection, isolation, and recovery(FDIR) platform.

I am eager to continue my research work and confident in my ability to excel as a highly self-motivated PhD candidate. If you are interested in collaborating with me, please feel free to contact me via email: _lichao_20011102@163.com_ [Contact me](mailto:lichao_20011102@163.com) or WeChat: _ch15172521750_.
